# About

Webdoko is a container for creative learning materials. Similar to the meaning and purpose of the Nepali word 'Doko' (in Nepali: डोको) which is a well-hand-woven basket made from dry bamboo strips to carry goods, this platform is carefully designed and developed to handle and pass on learning material for anyone who wants to either create and educate or learn and innovate.

This platform is for educators and learners. Businesses and consults can also take advantage of the services available in webdoko. Educators can create learning materials; share and educate; keep track of their courses through analytics, engage with students while they learn and also improve their material. Learners can enroll in various programs and courses, keep track of their achievements, showcase their work/effort, and discuss with the community of professionals.

As the core feature of webdoko is to host learning and educational material for a course or training program, this platform may come in very handy to educational institutions. It will be a great place to host courses for schools and universities.

Currently, we have made this platform suitable to hold informative resources. Now after its first release, to make the platform suitable for productive groups, we are working to upgrade this platform with features to develop and share instructional materials.

We always love to hear from our users. Any suggestion or complaint about this platform will help the platform become more usable and secure. Do let us know if there is anything we could do for you. We are always open to suggestions to develop a better experience in webdoko.
