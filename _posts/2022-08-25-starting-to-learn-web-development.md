They always have a lot of questions when you are trying to learn web development for the first time. A few tips in the beginning can always save you lots of time. Here are 5 tips for someone who is thinking to start web development:

- Let's say you decided to learn web development and you started to read something, then you started to code. If you feel sleepy within an hour, then forget about coding. You might wanna do something else. Search what you really want to do and do that. Find someone who has already been there (your goal that you want to achieve) and ask them about what you should plan to move forward.
- From this second point, let's assume you didn't feel sleepy the first hour of learning how to code.

If you are starting fresh, never go for video tutorials: At beginning, you are doing very fundamental things. So, it is crucial that you read and practice. Don't watch others doing simple things, do it yourself. These people are doing basic videos, just to monetize. Go to w3schools and start playing with the code.

- Don't start being fancy in the beginning: Boilerplate, REST framework, serverless and such kind of things feel appealing to a beginner but if you start using these things without understandings of the basic and the idea behind these, it looks dumb. It is really dumb idea.
- When you are going through the tutorial, it is hard to remember the code used and the structure of the syntax. Well, you don't need to remember them, in the first go. There are some syntax that you may never use in your lifetime. In the very beginning, you would not know which syntax is very useful and which is used very less. So, when you go through the tutorial, you don't need to remember but at least understand what the code is doing and how it is doing. What the code does and how it does is very important to know.
- Don't code whatever you want, thinking that you are just practicing. Don't do that. Before you practice, set a goal. Figure out what you want to get at the end of coding. Once you reach the goal, take a rest. Grab some coffee, watch a movie, do some social media and come back to coding when another thought hits you.

Hope these tips will help you move forward with learning web development. Happy learning!
