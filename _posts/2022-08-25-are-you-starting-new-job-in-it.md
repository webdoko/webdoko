Beginners in IT development who have recently joined a company always ask things like how they can learn a particular framework in the best way, some valid tutorial link in YouTube and they are also seeking good guidance. This blog is about 5 points that you need to know when you are new to an IT development company.

1. Learning is always there if you join a good organization but it is going to be a bit different than the way you learn in college. Either you enter an organization which is a startup or a structured company, you will find that you have to learn things more independently. Everyone is busy with their own work and all they can do to guide you is by telling you what to do next. The seniors won't tell you much about what to do. All they do is set your direction and that helps you save lots of time but you have to learn everything by yourself.

2. If you are planning to learn industry level development at home by following some tutorial and nothing else then it is going to be a waste of time. The environment, engagement, brainstorming and problem solving with the office team cannot be experienced from video tutorials. If you seriously want to learn that at home, don't just do the tutorial but engage with the online community and build something useful together in a group.

3. If you are starting to use a framework, always take official documentation as a reference. For learning a programming language, official documentation is quite big but for a framework, it's not. Always be action oriented while going through the documentation. If you already have been using frameworks and want to learn new one, find a crash course for the new framework. It will save you a good amount of time. But for beginners, I don't suggest crash courses. Beginners can use crash courses only after being familiar with at least 2 frameworks.

4. Create a habit to write and share documentation with team members. When you have to pass the work you do or if that work has to be followed in future documentation works great. This seems lousy and unnecessary but a very important task for both programmer and company. Most programmers find documentation important when they start getting lost in their code. Even most companies don't realize it's need unless they start to lose some money. A good programmer must be a good writer. Develop habits to prepare documentation and reports. It has a huge impact on the way you work.

5. Keep your network alive whether it is community or friend circle in tech. What happens with most tech people is that after finishing college they engage to some company and with some years of working experience, they find that they know very few people outside who are working in the same domain. This can make you feel lonely. If you keep building your network, you will find more and more learning opportunities everyday.

That's all for now. Hope these tips will help in some way to move forward with your career. Thanks for reading.
